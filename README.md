# Code-itry
The World in Code. 


The goal of Code-itry is to apply the logic of programing to the world at large. Use a high level object oriented programing languageto try and articulate things in code. Object oriented can mean any noun; a person place or idea. Transitivly an adjctive in Code-tiry will be applied to an object and enherit from the base calss, then add the discriptor. For example, there could be a base class wheel and a subclass would be squeaky wheel. Verbs on the other hand will be fucntions. An example of a verb would be to Meet. Meet can takes in two or more Person objects and creates a connection between them.

Code-itry should look like a form of poetry. It is human readable and parsable by someone who does not program. Think of creating a character in an RPG where there are base stats that have an integer value between 1 and 10. 

Every situation can be broken down into its key components and explained by a the Code-ist. This is where it gets interesting, everyone sees situations differently which means that they will be decomposed differently by other people.
